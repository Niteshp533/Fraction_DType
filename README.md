# Fraction_DType

This repository contains a Python class for representing fractions.

* A fraction is a number that represents a part of a whole. It is written as two numbers separated by a slash.
  
* The top number, called the numerator, represents the number of parts we have.
  
* The bottom number, called the denominator, represents the total number of parts in the whole.

## operations

* You can then perform the following operations on the fraction using the corresponding operators:

> Addition (+)

> Subtraction (-)

> Multiplication (*)

> True division (/)

> Greatest common divisor (GCD) (gcd)

> Least common multiple (LCM) (lcm)

## Conclusion

* The Fraction class is a powerful tool for working with fractions in Python.
  
* It provides a simple and intuitive way to create and manipulate fractions, and it supports all of the common operations on fractions.
  
  >  If you need to work with fractions in your Python code, I highly recommend using the Fraction class.
